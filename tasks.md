Description:
In this task, you will implement a simple program that spawns multiple threads to perform computations concurrently. The goal is to understand thread creation, joining, synchronization, and avoiding race conditions.

Input:

A list of numbers (e.g., [5, 10, 15, 20, 25])
Number of threads to use
Output:

The sum of the numbers calculated by multiple threads
Execution time comparison between single-threaded and multi-threaded execution
Covered Topics:
✅ std::thread – Creating and managing threads
✅ std::mutex – Preventing race conditions
✅ std::condition_variable – Thread synchronization
✅ std::future and std::async – Alternative threading models
